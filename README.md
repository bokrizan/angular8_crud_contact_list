After downloading the project, you need to switch to the working folder and run npm install through the console

After that run ng server for the dev server, and in the browser go to http: // localhost: 4200 /

## Note:
It is necessary to have Angular CLI installed.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

If it is installed and there is a run-time issue, do the following:

`npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli` `npm cache clean -f` `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
